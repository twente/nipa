		"PRED_TITLE": "Prediction",
		"PRED_BODY": "The algorithm uses the SIR model: every individual has a state which is either \"susceptible\", \"infectious\", or \"removed\". As a first step, the data is pre-processed in order to obtain an SIR model for each province. Based on this, the curing probability and infection probability between two provinces are determined. These values can then be used in combination with the available data to arrive at a prediction.<br><br>This type of prediction algorithm is network-based: the prediction is made based on the estimated interaction between provinces. Several studies have recently been conducted that apply this principle, all with promising results.<br><br>For details on the algorithm, please refer to the adjacent article.",

		"DATA_BODY": "The predictions displayed on the dashboard are based on publicly available data. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Dutch: <i>Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu</i> or <i>RIVM</i>) offers various data sources. The Esri data source is the most appropriate for this project.<sup>[1]</sup> This source includes the number of reports per municipality per day, which can then be added up to arrive at a total amount per province.<br><br>Because the prediction algorithm uses number of new infections per day and the data source only has the cumulative number of reports available, the number of new infections is determined by taking the difference between two consecutive days. Some additional pre-processing is required to address missing data and mistakes in the data.
